       <h1>Hello! Baxter here and I need your help!</h1>
        
        <p> My Mom (aka Steph) is not traning me enough and I super duper want to learn the commands 'touch', 'stay', and 'leave it'.</p>
        
        <p> She's been bringing around this loser, I think his name is Kevin, and he tries to teach me but he kind of sucks.</p>

        <p> So I really need some help in finding a good trainer, my contact info is as follows:</p>

         <table>
        <tr>
          <th>City</th>
          <th>State</th>
          <th>Phone Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Castro Valley</td>
          <td>California</td>
          <td>1-800-Baxters</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

        <p> Look at me in this picture, I am terrified! But that is besides the point.</p>
