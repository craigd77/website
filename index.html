       <h1>Hello! Baxter here, and I need your help!</h1>
        
        <p> My Mom (aka Steph) is not traning me enough and I super duper want to learn the command 'touch'.</p>
        
        <p> She been bringing around this loser, I think his name is Kevin, and he tries to teach me but it's not up to my standard</p>

        <p> So any help here will be greatly appreciated, my contact info is as follows:</p>

         <table>
        <tr>
          <th>City</th>
          <th>State</th>
          <th>Phone Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Castro Valley</td>
          <td>California</td>
          <td>1-800-Baxters</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

        <img src="images/Baxter3.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Dog"/>
